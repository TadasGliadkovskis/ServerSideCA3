# Computer Parts Shop

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to create a secure CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
application using PHP and MySQL. This project connects to a MySQL database using a PDO connection and has client-side form validation.
It has been styled using SCSS and all the files are uploaded onto the DKIT web server
